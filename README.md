✝️ Jesus Follower | Systems Administrator | DevOps & Cloud Learner

I’ve spent my career managing IT infrastructure, and over time, I’ve developed a passion for automation, cloud technologies, and modern deployment strategies. My current focus is on Proxmox, Ansible, Terraform, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to create scalable, efficient, and repeatable solutions.

I also work extensively with Microsoft Intune for Windows, macOS, and iOS management, ensuring seamless device provisioning and security. Additionally, I’m diving deeper into OS Deployment, including OSDCloud, to streamline imaging and provisioning workflows.

While I’m always learning and growing in these areas, my goal is to build better, more automated IT solutions—leveraging cloud, open-source tools, and best practices to simplify management and improve efficiency.

🔹 Faith, technology, and continuous learning—one step at a time.
